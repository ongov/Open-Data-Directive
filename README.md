1 Introduction
---------------

This Directive outlines requirements for ministries and provincial agencies on
listing all data inventories, publishing open data, and preparing information
systems to support ongoing open data requirements.

The open data initiative supports government efficiency, effectiveness and
innovation. Faster and easier access to government data through a one-window
data portal facilitates evidence-based policy, informs service delivery and
promotes greater transparency and accountability.

The open data initiative also supports public engagement and participation by
allowing Ontarians to develop their own analysis, insights, and digital
products.

To support this implementation of the directive, an Open Data Guidebook is
available as a tool and resource to Ontario ministries and provincial agencies.

The Open Data Directive is a Management Board of Cabinet Directive, issued under
the *Management Board of Cabinet Act*.

2 Purpose
----------

The purpose of this directive is to maximize access to data by requiring that
government data be open by default unless exempted from release in limited and
specific circumstances as specified in this directive.

For the purpose of this directive, “**data”** is defined as facts, figures and
statistics objectively measured according to a standard or scale, such as
frequency, volumes or occurrences, but does not include Information (as defined
by this directive).

This directive:

-   Instructs ministries and provincial agencies to release government data that
    they create, collect, and/or manage as open data, unless the data is exempt
    from release as open data, pursuant to this directive.

-   Defines principles and requirements for publishing government data as open
    data.

-   Promotes a culture of openness and collaboration both within the public
    service and externally with the people of Ontario.

3 Application and Scope
------------------------

This directive applies to all Ontario ministries and provincial agencies.

This directive applies to all government data.

This directive promotes data management practices which enable the proactive and
ongoing release of government data and is to be implemented in a manner that is
consistent with existing legal obligations, restrictions and requirements,
including the *Simpler, Faster, Better Services Act, 2019,* the *Archives and
Recordkeeping Act, 2006*, the *Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy
Act, 1990*, the *Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004*, the *French
Language Services Act, 1990*, and the *Accessibility for Ontarians with
Disabilities Act, 2005* or other applicable legislation.

4 Principles
-------------

Government data is open by default unless exempted from release in limited and
specific circumstances as specified in this directive.

Personal Information is not to be released as open data under the terms of the
Open Government Licence – Ontario (OGL) and/or a similar open licence. However,
where there is sufficient statutory authority to release personal information,
and where it is appropriate, personal information may be made available in a
machine-readable format.

Government ensures exempted data remains secure and is managed responsibly.

When government data can be made available to the public, it will be released
over the internet in an open format, at no charge to the user, and will be
released under the Open Government Licence – Ontario (see Appendix A) and/or a
similar open licence where appropriate.

Open data, to the fullest extent possible, is available in its original,
unmodified form.

Open data is accurate, timely, openly accessible, interpretable, coherent and
primary (adapted from the [Statistics Canada Data Quality
Guidelines](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/12-539-X)) and released
in accordance with the principles in the [International Open Data
Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/).

5 Requirements
---------------

The directive requires government data be open by default unless exempted from
release in limited and specific circumstances as set out below:

-   Data that is subject to statutory confidentiality requirements, (i.e. exempt
    from publication under the *Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy
    Act, 1990*, the *Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004* and/or
    other statutes).

-   Data that should not be disclosed for legal, security, confidentiality,
    privacy or commercial sensitivity reasons.

### 5.1 Data Inventory:

1.  The Chief Digital and Data Officer will establish, coordinate and maintain a
    comprehensive government-wide data inventory. This data inventory will be
    published online and will be accessible to the public.

2.  The Chief Digital and Data Officer will identify common core metadata
    elements and data standards, where applicable, to describe items listed in
    the inventory.

3.  Each ministry and provincial agency must create an inventory of datasets
    within its custody and control.

4.  Each ministry who has custody and control of datasets must contribute to the
    government-wide data inventory by providing to the Chief Digital and Data
    Officer a listing of all datasets or categories of data.

5.  Provincial agencies must publish their inventories on a new web page on
    their site or, in its absence, another government website in accordance with
    the Open Data Guidebook and provide the link to their inventory to the Chief
    Digital and Data Officer.

6.  Ministries and provincial agencies are responsible for keeping their
    inventory list up-to-date on an ongoing basis.

7.  Ministries and provincial agencies must identify any dataset which cannot be
    made accessible to the public as open data on its inventory. In addition to
    identifying such datasets, the ministry or provincial agency must provide a
    detailed explanation as to why the dataset cannot be made accessible to the
    public as open data (e.g., exempt because of legislation, contains personal,
    confidential or commercially sensitive information, security, contains data
    for which Ontario does not have the necessary rights to make available as
    open data).

8.  For each dataset listed in the inventory that can be made accessible to the
    public as open data, ministries and provincial agencies must identify in the
    inventory, on an ongoing basis, if that dataset will be released as open
    data.

9.  In exceptional cases, ministries and provincial agencies may exclude a
    dataset from their inventory where the organization is prevented from
    disclosing the data by law or it is authorized by law to refuse to confirm
    or deny the existence of data.

### 5.2 Open Data Publication:

1.  All ministry open data must be made available in the Ontario Data Catalogue,
    which is a central platform for all open data published by ministries and is
    administered by the Chief Digital and Data Officer. See Appendix B for
    information on approval authority in ministries for publishing datasets on
    the Ontario Data Catalogue, including any possible delegations of authority.

2.  Provincial agencies must publish all open data following open data
    requirements. See Appendix B for information on approval authority in
    provincial agencies for publishing datasets, including any possible
    delegations of authority.

3.  Ministries and provincial agencies must follow the Open Data Guidebook to
    ensure government data being released as open data meets required criteria.

4.  Ministries and provincial agencies should prioritize the publication of
    datasets frequently requested by the public, collected in support of
    government priorities or mandated by legislation.

5.  All open data must be released in an open format.

6.  Open data must be released at no charge to the user and under the Open
    Government Licence – Ontario (See Appendix A) and/or a similar open licence
    where appropriate.

7.  Ministries and provincial agencies must review and update datasets released
    as open data periodically to ensure accuracy and timeliness.

8.  No datasets released as open data are to be deleted or removed from public
    access except where a dataset was published in error:

-   8.1 In situations where active maintenance and update of a dataset is
    discontinued, or where any published dataset has to be replaced with a newer
    or modified version, the dataset description must be updated in the
    catalogue to reflect the “inactive” status, without restricting public
    access to the dataset.

    8.2 Where custody and control for a dataset is transferred from one program
    area to another program area, the new program area must update the dataset
    description in the Ontario Data Catalogue to reflect this.

9.  When legislation mandates the release of data but does not specifically
    prescribe the format, ministries and provincial agencies should make best
    efforts to apply open data principles (i.e., listed in Ontario Data
    Catalogue, in an open format under the Open Government Licence – Ontario
    and/or a similar open licence where appropriate).

10.  In cases where ministries and provincial agencies apply fees to process a
    request for data, they must review the current practice to assess if
    releasing it as open data would be a more effective and efficient way of
    providing the data. This does not apply to freedom of information requests
    made under the *Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act*
    application and processing fees or other fees authorized by or under
    statute.

11.  Open data is to be published in the Ontario Data Catalogue in the language
    it was collected. The dataset title, description, and all accompanying
    information must be available simultaneously in both English and French.

### 5.3 Procurement and Contracts:

1.  To enable the release of open data, ministries and provincial agencies must,
    at minimum, include in all new government contracts with vendors, provisions
    that address the following concepts:

-   1.1 The government of Ontario will obtain the right to publish procurement
    contract data as open data. Procurement contract data such as the winning
    bid for every contract awarded (e.g. vendor name, financial payment
    information) should be included and published in a timely manner, unless
    excluded from being made available as open data. Vendors shall agree that
    financial data of contracts are not considered commercially sensitive and
    may be released.

    1.2 The government of Ontario will obtain the right to publish as open data
    original data created or collected as an output of contracts with suppliers,
    unless the data should be excluded from being made available as open data.

2.  The Treasury Board Secretariat must ensure that open data requirements
    (e.g., extraction of data in an open format) are built into enterprise
    architecture, project approval and project assurance processes.

3.  All ministries and provincial agencies are accountable to include open data
    requirements (i.e., extraction of data in an open format) into their
    architecture review and project approval processes.

4.  All data management platforms, applications and solutions acquired or built
    must have features as a core function that allow for the extraction of
    content into an open format. This may be accomplished through application
    programming interfaces (API) in accordance with common best practices
    presented in the Open Data Guidebook.

6 Open Data Engagement
-----------------------

As part of Ontario’s Open Government Initiative, ministries and provincial
agencies should develop plans to promote open data under the guidance of the
Ontario Digital Service and their specific communication branches. Ministries
and provincial agencies should communicate the strategic value of open data to
stakeholders and the public.

1.  Work within the Ontario Public Service, Broader Public Sector and with the
    public and stakeholders to assist in identifying and prioritizing the
    release of datasets at the community, regional and provincial levels to
    support social research and planning.

2.  Work with industry stakeholders to raise awareness of the economic potential
    of open data and to prioritize the release of datasets to support economic
    activities.

3.  Leverage educational programs and tools to promote data literacy within
    their ministries/provincial agencies and with their stakeholders under the
    guidance of the Ontario Digital Service.

4.  Promote the use of government data and digital applications and services
    with stakeholders.

5.  Evaluate the potential of sharing the data internally and/or with relevant
    external organizations in secure environments in cases where government data
    cannot be broadly shared as open data.

6.  The Ontario Digital Service will coordinate with stakeholders and other
    levels of government to increase the interoperability and relevance of data.
    This includes collecting community input, feedback and improving open data
    quality standards.
